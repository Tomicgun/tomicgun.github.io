# Gravity Waves Analysis Tool

## Summary
-In collaboration with nasa
-Built to replace existing tool that is very expensive and only usable on one machine
-Is a web app that allows users to upload pre-formated weather ballon data and allows for quick calculations of commonly needed data
-Also creates many graphs and other visual representation all graphs commonly needed by NASA and other meteorologist.
-Nasa now uses this application and can be used by any other person that wants to self-host the web application 
-part of larger project due to the solar eclipse going on in the area


## Solution / Design
-flask web app
-the front end takes in text document and outputs a pdf file
-backend parses the text document then stores data into a local dataframe
-backend then interprets the data and calculates the 12 numeric metrics
-backend then creates the 9 graphs
-backend then takes all the data and graphs and combines into one pdf and outputs this pdf file back to the front end
-front end then outputs this file to the user
-the metrics and graphs output where determined by stakeholders
-we use variety of python scientific libraries to create graphs and calculate the metrics and hold the data 

## Main Problem
-flask
-docker
-team members
-stakeholder changing goals

## Tech Stack
-python
-flask

## Demo Video
-find demo video

## Conclusion 
-great success
-fun to work with nasa
