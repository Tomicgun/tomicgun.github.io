## Hello and welcome to my Portfolio and blog!

## About me

Hi, my name is Thomas Marten, and I am a recent graduate from SUNY oswego, I started program fairly late at
the ripe old age of 19. Initially I wanted to be a doctor or do somthing in the medical field, but by the 
time I entered college at SUNY Stony Brook I realized that I can't take another bio course in my life, and that I want to try this
programming thing that looks cool.

The rest is history, but one major change and transfer to SUNY Oswego I have spent the last 4 years of my college life
working with cool people on cool projects. Projects you can explore when you are done here. I have done a lot of varried stuff
from CLI tools, websites, research papers, and various other projects. My great love is video game programming,
and it is the main project type that I do in my free time.

That's it from me, have a great rest of your day and if you have any question feel free to reach out
to me on my socials!
